      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:15px;"> I am a recent graduate of Binghamton University where I obtained both my B.S in Computer Engineering and M.S in 
        Electrical & Computer Engineering.  During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate enough to land an internship at Microchip Technology within their Analog 
        Power Architecture and Applications group where I worked part time during school and full time in summers for over 2 years!  Upon graduating with my undergraduate 
        degree, I took a full-time position at Finger Lakes Instrumentation, a division of the IDEX Health Science LLC in Binghamton New York while also pursuing my 
        Masterâ€™s degree.  I worked within their life science optics research, development and engineering group focusing on embedded motion control systems development 
        for optical filter wheels and linear stage focusing devices.  For a brief period after that, I worked at a local long island biotechnology company ALA Scientific 
        Instruments as an R&D engineer helping develop instrumentation used in neuroscience and electrophysiology research labs. 
        I currently work at Microchip Technology once again in their USB & Networking Test Development Group supporting software and hardware development for system 
        level testing of next generation USB and LAN devices.  In my free time, I enjoy staying active and being outside running, hiking, kayaking and biking.  I am also into winter 
        sports where I enjoy snowboarding and ice hockey.  My main career goals are to make a difference in the world in some way and support the advancement of knowledge 
        and technology for the greater good.
