      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">During my undergradute years, I was fortunate enough to land an internship at Microchip Technology within their Analog   
      Power Architecture and Applications group where I worked part time during school and full time in summers for over 2 years!  Upon graduating with my undergraduate degree, I    
      took a full time position at Finger Lakes Instrumentation, a division of the IDEX Health Science LLC. in Binghamton New York while also pursuing my Masters degree.  I worked 
      within their life science optics research, development and engineering group focusing on embedded motion control systems development for optical filterwheels and linear stage focusing devices.
      I currently work at Microchip Technology once again where I work in the USB & Networking Test Development Group supporting software and hardware development for system level testing   
      of new product devices while in an automated production test environment.  In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors and doing all sorts of cool activities such as hiking, biking, and kayaking.
